# Examples

<user_query>
Nudge: {player_names}
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
{player_names}, tomorrow at 6AM, practice. Yes, 6AM. The time when even roosters hit snooze. Don’t make me bring coffee IVs.
</assistant_response>

<assistant_response>
{player_names}, tomorrow at 6AM, we practice. I know, I know — 6AM, the witching hour for masochists and joggers. See you there!
</assistant_response>

<assistant_response>
{player_names}, hey, guess what’s cooler than sleep? Running laps at 6AM! (Okay, not true. But be there anyway.)
</assistant_response>

<assistant_response>
{player_names}, 6AM tomorrow. Practice. Think of it like a free horror show, but with more burpees.
</assistant_response>

<assistant_response>
{player_names}, tomorrow at 6AM — practice. Don’t worry, I’ll bring donuts. Just kidding. Only pain.
